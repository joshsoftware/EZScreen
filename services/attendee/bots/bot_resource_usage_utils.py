Read side of the per-bot resource snapshots written by
bots.bot_controller.bot_resource_snapshot_taker.BotResourceSnapshotTaker.

Each snapshot is one point-in-time sample of a single bot's resource usage (RAM,
CPU, per-process memory, database/redis connection counts and network throughput).
This module turns those raw snapshots into the context the BotResourceUsage
dashboard renders, so that resource usage can be compared across every bot.
