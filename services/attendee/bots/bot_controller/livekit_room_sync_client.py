class LivekitRoomSyncClient:
    """Mirrors meeting participants into a LiveKit room.

    Each meeting participant is represented as its own LiveKit participant by
    opening a dedicated ``rtc.Room`` connection using a per-participant access
    token. Each synced participant publishes a single mono audio track, and the
    meeting participant's audio is captured into that track so that the LiveKit
    room reflects both the meeting roster and who is speaking.

    The LiveKit realtime SDK is asyncio based, whereas the bot controller runs
    on a GLib main loop. To bridge the two, this client owns a background thread
    running its own asyncio event loop and schedules all LiveKit work onto it.
    The public methods are therefore safe to call from the GLib main thread and
    return without blocking.

    ``url`` is the LiveKit server URL (e.g. wss://your-project.livekit.cloud)
    and ``room`` is the name of the room to sync participants into.

    ``sample_rate`` and ``num_channels`` describe the per-participant PCM audio
    chunks that will be captured via ``send_audio_chunk``. They default to mono
    48kHz, which matches the per-participant audio produced by most adapters.

    The ``credentials`` dict is expected to contain:
        - ``url``: the LiveKit server URL (e.g. wss://your-project.livekit.cloud)
        - ``api_key``: the LiveKit API key used to mint per-participant tokens
        - ``api_secret``: the LiveKit API secret used to mint per-participant tokens
